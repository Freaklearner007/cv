            <h3><strong>10 Things You Don't Know About Albert Einstein</strong></h3>
        </center>
            <ul style="color:white;">
                <li>He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to
                    relate
                    to genius. However, it is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math was
                    one
                    area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.</li><br>
                <li>Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is often misinterpreted,
                    with some claiming that he helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter
                    to President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project.
                    Although a dedicated pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that
                    America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.</li><br>
                <li>He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work out, Einstein could have become a
                    violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin
                    lessons—at the young age of five.</li><br>
                <li>His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain
                    without permission. He eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was fired
                    from Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over forty years before
                    finally returning it in 1998.</li>
            </ul>
